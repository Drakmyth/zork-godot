# zork-godot

This is an implementation of the 1980 interactive fiction game Zork I built on the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org).

The ZIL (Zork Implementation Language) code [published by historicalsource](https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1) in 2019 served as a significant inspiration and source of reference. This project is not intended to be a direct port of that source, rather it serves as a proof of concept for building full-scale interactive fiction games using Godot.

The [ZIL Manual](https://archive.org/details/Learning_ZIL_Steven_Eric_Meretzky_1995/) published by Steven Eric Meretzky in 1995 and uploaded to the Internet Archive also served as a key source of reference.
